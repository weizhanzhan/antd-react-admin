# TypeScript重构 企业级管理后台

## 记录bug
- 因为router.config里的component写成了components 导致报了下面的错
`
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
